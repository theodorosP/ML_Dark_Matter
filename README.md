# Machine Learning for Dark Matter Detection


I've crafted cutting-edge deep learning models that outshine previous research in distinguishing WIMP dark matter candidate events from pesky background radiation. Alpha particles, a notorious challenge in experiments like FERMI-LAT and ICE CUBE, are a major pain to separate from the signal.

I've harnessed the power of machine learning to tackle this issue head-on. Even with impure calibration data in FERMI-LAT and the spherical shape of one of the ICE-CUBE detectors throwing curveballs, I've cracked the code with my supervised learning algorithms. These beauties have worked wonders, cleansing the impurity in PICO-60 data and boosting accuracy from a modest 80.7% to an impressive 99.2%.
